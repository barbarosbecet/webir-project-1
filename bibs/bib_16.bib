	zum Ermitteln einer Ähnlichkeit zwischen zumindest einem Eingabedokument
	und einer Anzahl von Dokumenten. Es werden erste Dokumente und zweite
	Dokumente ermittelt, welche direkt oder indirekt von dem Eingabedokument

	ermittelte Dokument wird mindestens ein vorläufiger Ähnlichkeitswert

	berechnet worden, wird aus den vorläufigen Ähnlichkeitswerten ein
	endgültiger Ähnlichkeitswert berechnet. Das Verfahren kann wiederum
	auf die ermittelten ersten Dokumente und zweiten Dokumente angewandt
	werden, um weitere ähnliche Dokumente zu dem Eingabedokument zu ermitteln
	und deren Ähnlichkeitswerte zu dem Eingabedokument zu berechnen.
	
	(EN) The invention relates to a computer-implemented method for detecting
	a similarity between at least one input document and a plurality
	of documents. First documents and second documents are detected which
	are directly or indirectly cited by the input document or which directly
	or indirectly cite the input document. At least one preliminary similarity
	value is calculated for every detected document. If more than one
	preliminary similarity value has been calculated for a document,
	a final similarity value is calculated from the preliminary similarity
	values. The method can then be applied to the detected first documents
	and second documents to detect further documents that are similar
	to the input document and to calculate their similarity values to
	the input document.

	pour chaque document déterminé. Si plus d'une valeur de similarité
	provisoire a été calculée pour un document, une valeur de similarité
	définitive est calculée à partir des valeurs de similarité provisoire.

	enthaelt aber zusaetzlich einen Beschleunigungssensor und einen Mikrokontroller
	zum Auswerten der Messdaten. Mit dieser Technik ist es moeglich,
	jedes handelsuebliche Mobiltelefon zu einem mobilen Schutzengel aufzuruesten,
	der Unfaelle sicher erkennt. Fehlalarme, beispielsweise durch Vollbremsungen
	waehrend der Autofahrt oder Hinunterfallen des Mobiltelefons, sind
	dabei ausgeschlossen. Bei einem Unfall ruft der GSM Schutzengel sofort
	die Rettungskraefte herbei. Dadurch kann selbst bewusstlosen Fahrern
	schnellstmoeglich geholfen werden. Die Position des Unfalls wird
	dabei ueber das Mobilfunknetz bestimmt - bis auf 150 m genau. Somit
	kann zielgenaue Hilfe gewaehrleistet werden, denn wer kann schon
	direkt nach einem Unfall beschreiben, wo genau er ist?}
